# Social-Distancing-Detector
Please run the "createmodel.py" file with "yolov3-320.cfg" as the argument. This will create the weights and model in the same folder. Next run "model.py" with appropriate input file to detect people not maintaining social distance. The above code is written to read and write on a video file we can modify it for realtime use too.
